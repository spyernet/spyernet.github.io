  <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
  <h2>Spyernet™ Operating System</h2>

  <div class="meta">
    Last Updated: 23 January 2026
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
    <p>
      These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”, “Agreement”) constitute a legally
      binding agreement between you (“User”, “You”, “Your”) and the Spyernet
      Project, its maintainers, contributors, licensors, and affiliates
      (“Spyernet”, “We”, “Us”, “Our”), governing your access to, installation,
      execution, modification, distribution, and use of the Spyernet™
      Operating System (“Spyernet OS”, “Operating System”, “Software”).
    </p>
    <p>
      By downloading, installing, copying, accessing, booting, executing,
      modifying, distributing, or otherwise using Spyernet OS, whether in
      source code or binary form, on physical hardware, virtual machines,
      containers, cloud infrastructure, or embedded environments, you
      expressly acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be
      bound by these Terms in their entirety.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do not agree to these Terms, you must immediately cease all use
      of the proprietary portions of Spyernet OS. Your rights under applicable
      open-source licenses are not affected by rejection of these Terms, but
      access to proprietary components is strictly conditioned upon
      acceptance.
    </p>
    <p>
      You represent and warrant that you have the legal capacity and authority
      to enter into this Agreement, and if you are acting on behalf of an
      organization, that you are duly authorized to bind that entity.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>2. Composition of the Operating System</h3>
    <p>
      Spyernet OS is a composite operating system distribution consisting of
      multiple distinct software components, each governed by its own
      licensing terms. These components include, but are not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Open Source Software components licensed under the GNU General Public
        License (GPL), GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), MIT License,
        BSD Licenses, Apache License, and other OSI-approved licenses
      </li>
      <li>
        Proprietary software components developed, owned, or licensed by
        Spyernet, including system management tools, configuration layers,
        branding assets, and integration logic
      </li>
      <li>
        Third-party proprietary software distributed under separate license
        agreements, including but not limited to Steam and related platforms
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each component remains subject to its own applicable license, and no
      single license governs the Operating System as a whole. Nothing in
      these Terms shall be interpreted as modifying or superseding the terms
      of any applicable open-source license.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>3. Open Source Software Rights</h3>
    <p>
      Spyernet OS includes substantial portions of free and open-source
      software, including but not limited to the Linux kernel (including Linux
      Zen), GNU core utilities, Bash, XFCE4, system libraries, and associated
      tooling.
    </p>
    <p>
      All open-source components are licensed to you under their respective
      licenses. Your rights to use, study, modify, and redistribute such
      components are governed exclusively by those licenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing in these Terms is intended to restrict, limit, or interfere with
      rights granted under open-source licenses. In the event of any conflict
      between these Terms and an open-source license, the open-source license
      shall control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where required by applicable open-source licenses, Spyernet provides
      access to corresponding source code through publicly available
      repositories or upon written request, subject to reasonable verification
      and compliance procedures.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>4. License for Proprietary Components</h3>
    <p>
      Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, Spyernet grants
      you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
      non-sublicensable license to install and use the proprietary components
      of Spyernet OS solely for lawful purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This license does not convey any ownership interest. All proprietary
      components, including but not limited to binaries, scripts, system
      configurations, visual assets, trademarks, logos, and documentation,
      remain the exclusive property of Spyernet or its licensors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any use outside the scope expressly permitted herein is strictly
      prohibited and may result in immediate termination of this license.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>5. Redistribution Policy</h3>
    <p>
      Redistribution of open-source components is permitted strictly in
      accordance with their applicable licenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redistribution, sublicensing, mirroring, hosting, selling, leasing,
      bundling, or otherwise transferring proprietary Spyernet components,
      system images, preinstalled environments, or branding elements is
      prohibited without prior explicit written authorization from Spyernet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unauthorized redistribution may result in civil liability, termination
      of licenses, and injunctive relief.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>6. Commercial Use and License Fees</h3>
    <p>
      Commercial use of Spyernet proprietary components may require payment of
      license fees, subscription fees, or enterprise agreements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pricing, licensing models, and eligibility criteria are published at
      https://spyernet.github.io and may be updated at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Failure to comply with applicable commercial licensing terms constitutes
      a material breach of this Agreement.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>7. Prohibited Conduct</h3>
    <p>
      Except where expressly permitted by applicable open-source licenses, you
      shall not:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble proprietary components</li>
      <li>Circumvent licensing, activation, or usage restrictions</li>
      <li>Remove or obscure copyright, trademark, or license notices</li>
      <li>Use the Software for unlawful, infringing, or malicious purposes</li>
      <li>Misrepresent Spyernet OS as your own product</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>8. Third-Party Software</h3>
    <p>
      Spyernet OS may include or interface with third-party software governed
      by independent license agreements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spyernet makes no representations or warranties regarding third-party
      software and disclaims all liability arising from its use.
